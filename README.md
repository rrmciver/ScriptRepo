# ScriptRepo
Welome to my personal script repository, which contains some of the scripts and solutions developed over the course of my career as an IT professional.

I share these scripts with the community for reference and knowledge sharing only. I do my best to thoroughly document and test all of my scripts before adding them here but, if you choose to download and use any one of them, please note the following disclaimer:

All scripts provided were developed for, and tested in, specific environments and infrastructures. Please be sure to test all scripts in an isoloated development environment and make modifications as needed. Do not use these scripts in or with any production environment. I make no guarentees, offer no support, and assume no liability as a result.
